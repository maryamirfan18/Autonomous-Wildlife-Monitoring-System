# -Autonomous-Wildlife-Monitoring-System-

---

An AI-powered system for real-time wildlife detection, sound classification, and movement tracking using computer vision (YOLOv5/YOLOv8), audio analysis, and graph-based path modeling. Designed for non-intrusive monitoring in wildlife reserves, safari parks, and zoos.

## Problem Statement 
In today's conservation efforts, monitoring wildlife behavior and population 
dynamics is crucial for understanding ecosystems and ensuring species 
preservation. Traditional methods often require human intervention, which 
can be intrusive and time-consuming. An autonomous wildlife monitoring 
system aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced AI 
techniques to detect, classify, and analyze wildlife activities in real-time. 

##  Project Objective

The Autonomous Wildlife Monitoring System is designed to operate in 
environments like safari parks or zoos, where continuous observation and 
data collection are essential. By integrating technologies such as object 
detection, sound analysis, and graph-based movement tracking, the system 
aims to provide accurate and comprehensive insights into animal behaviors. 


## 🔍 Features <br>
Object Detection: Detects and tracks animals in images and video using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8.<br>

🔊 Sound Analysis: Classifies animal sounds using audio preprocessing and feature extraction.<br>

📊 Graph-Based Movement Tracking: Visualizes animal movement paths using Breadth-First Search (BFS) in a graph.<br>

💾 Video Annotation Output: Saves annotated video showing animal movement.<br>

📊 Scalable for Continuous Monitoring: Designed to run autonomously for long-term wildlife studies.<br>
